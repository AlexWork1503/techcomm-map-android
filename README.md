# Tech Comm on a Map

Tech Comm on a Map puts technical communication events and other items of interest onto an
interactive map, together with the data and functionality provided by Google Maps. It's available as
a [web page](http://sarahmaddox.github.io/techcomm-map/) and as an Android app. This repo contains
the code for the Android app.
