# Tech Comm on a Map

Tech Comm on a Map puts technical communication events and other items of interest onto an
interactive map, together with the data and functionality provided by Google Maps. It's available as
as [an Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.techcomm.map.mobile)
and also as a [web page](http://sarahmaddox.github.io/techcomm-map/). This repo contains
the code for the Android app.
